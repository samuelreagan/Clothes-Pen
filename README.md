# Clothes Pen
This project was created for a web design competition in PBL (Phi Beta Lambda). My partner and I were tasked to design a website for an imaginary, non-profit clothing store. We implemented the website with a playful color scheme, minimalistic design, interactive interface, responsive capabilities, and informative content.

My duties were to help visualize the design, create the mockups, and construct the website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

This website won first at the Arkansas State PBL Conference and then went on to win second place at the 2018 PBL National Leadership Conference in Baltimore, MD.
